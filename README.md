I developed an Adidas Analysis dashboard using data from an Excel file, focusing on key metrics like total sales, profit, and regional performance. This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of sales trends across different regions, product categories, and time periods. By visualizing profit margins and regional sales comparisons, the dashboard enables in-depth analysis of market performance and helps in identifying areas for growth and optimization. My use of Excel to organize, analyze, and visualize the data highlights my expertise in creating insightful, data-driven solutions.

This project is about an overall performance of a ADIDAS in the Global Market.
